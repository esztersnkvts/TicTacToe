# Tic Tac Toe

This project implements a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game, where you can play against the computer.

The computer's choices are based on the *minimax algorithm*. You can change how smart you want the computer to be by limiting the depth of the search tree. You can do that by changing the MAX_DEPTH value. The higher this constant is, the smarter the computer will be.

### Running

To start the game run **main.py**. Player 'X' starts first.
